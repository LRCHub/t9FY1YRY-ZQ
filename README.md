```lrc
[00:24.38] Within a perfect dream, I felt the rain
[00:27.56] Suddenly as it started pouring
[00:30.58] Soaked on through, but I kept on walking
[00:33.34] My soul shaking from the cold
[00:47.84] 
[00:36.08] And with these hands
[00:37.42] I gathered the memories
[00:39.45] Though they're losing color and fading
[00:42.36] I held to the hope they could maybe
[00:45.11] Patch the hollow of my heart
[00:59.11] 
[00:48.45] This thing called love
[00:51.25] Know I would've
[00:54.13] Thrown it all away, wouldn't hesitate
[00:59.58] If I could find what I have lost along the way
[01:22.58] 
[01:08.34] If to feel pain is my fate
[01:11.59] Then I have just one thing to say
[01:14.32] Here in my scarred-covered heart
[01:17.25] Color will always exist
[01:20.38] I watch the last stardust, rise up and fly
[01:26.15] Dust to dust
[01:28.13] Ash to ash into the sky
[01:32.13] These fragments of my hopes and dreams, never die
[01:56.63] 
[01:46.78] Quietly with the receding rainfall
[01:49.85] The night wind, it suddenly withdrawals
[01:52.95] With my broken heart I stand alone
[01:55.97] Only silence at my side
[02:07.47] 
[01:59.22] I wouldn't mind if it's a lie
[02:04.71] If all of my rights they turned into wrongs
[02:10.21] As long as I protect the things that I believe
[02:33.21] 
[02:18.94] Another scar, one more scratch
[02:22.27] To my heart that's made out of glass
[02:25.02] It lights a spark, burning hot
[02:27.82] One I had nearly forgot
[02:39.32] 
[02:30.94] I watch the last stardust, rise up and fly
[02:36.71] Dust to dust
[02:38.37] Earth to earth, I say goodbye
[02:42.42] These fragments of my hopes and dreams, give me life
[03:08.42] 
[02:57.33] Brave shine
[03:09.63] Stay the night
[03:21.38] Save my life
[03:32.85] Your brave shine
[03:44.89] Brave shine
[03:50.39] 
[03:53.54] If to feel pain is my fate
[03:56.79] Then I have just one thing to say
[03:59.47] Here in my scarred covered heart
[04:02.58] Color will always exist
[04:05.68] Kiss me farewell, Judas! Turning to ash
[04:11.40] Dust to dust
[04:13.33] This weakness of my distant past
[04:29.33] 
[04:17.57] Another scar, one more scratch
[04:20.76] To my heart that's made out of glass
[04:23.56] It lights a spark, burning hot
[04:26.31] One I had nearly forgot
[04:37.81] 
[04:29.74] I'll watch the last stardust, rise up and fly
[04:35.22] Dust to dust
[04:36.77] Ash to ash into the sky
[04:40.91] These fragments of my hopes and dreams, never die
